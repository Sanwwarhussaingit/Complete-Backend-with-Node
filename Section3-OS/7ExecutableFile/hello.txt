An executable file is a type of computer file that contains a program that can be directly executed by the operating system. These files usually have extensions like .exe (on Windows), .bin (on Linux), or .app (on macOS). When you double-click or run an executable file, the operating system reads the machine code inside it and executes the program.

Executables can be compiled from source code written in programming languages like C++, Java, or Python, where the human-readable code is translated into machine code that the computer can execute.
